## 01 Learning Data Science

+ **Data science** is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.

+ **Data science:** It's one of the most exciting and fastest-growing fields out there.

+ **Data scientists** bring value to all kinds of businesses and organizations.

+ Data science languages includes R, Python, Matlab, Julia and their libraries


## 02.01 Programming in R

- R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting.

+ R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.R made its first appearance in 1993.


## 02.02 Features of R

+ R is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

+ R has an effective data handling and storage facility,

+ R provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and matrices.

+ R provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis.

+ R provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or printing at the papers.

## 02.03 R Workflow and Packages

+ A workflow of data manipulation in R and required packages.

## 03.01 R Syntax Rules

+ R follows the order of operations in mathematics. Syntax rules that govern the arrangement of symbols, words, and phrases. Sample code showing R performing simple mathematical calculations.
```{r code1, echo = TRUE}
145 + 5
125 - 3
167 * 8
555/5

(67 + 45)/9 * 45 + 28
```

## 03.02 Exercise

Write code to instruct R to perform the following computations:

+ 224 + 667
+ 35 / 7
+ (22 * 5) + 3


## 04.01 R Data Types

+ Variables are reserved memory locations to store values. 
+ Variables store information of various data types like character, wide character, integer, floating point, double floating point, Boolean etc.
+ Frequently used R objects:

    + Vectors
    + Lists
    + Matrices
    + Arrays
    + Factors
    + Data Frames
    
## 04.02.01 Data Types Looked Close

### Logical

+ Example : TRUE, FALSE

```{r code3, echo=TRUE}
v <- TRUE 
print(class(v))
typeof(v)
```

### Numeric

Numeric data may include integer data, or whole numbers (88), and double data, or decimals (87.666667).

+ Example : 12.3, 5, 999

```{r code4, echo=TRUE}
v <- 23.5
print(class(v))
```

### Integer

+ Example : 2L, 34L, 0L

```{r code5, echo=TRUE}
v <- 2L
print(class(v))
```

## 04.02.02 Data Types Looked Close

### Complex

Example: 3 + 2i

```{r code6, echo=TRUE}
v <- 2+5i
print(class(v))
```

### Characters

Example : 'a' , '"good", "TRUE", '23.4'

```{r code7, echo=TRUE}
v <- "TRUE"
print(class(v))
```

### Raw

Example : "Hello" is stored as 48 65 6c 6c 6f

```{r code8,echo=TRUE}
v <- charToRaw("Hello")
print(class(v))
```


## 04.03 Vectors

When you want to create vector with more than one element, you should use `c()` function which means to combine the elements into a vector.

```{r code9, echo= TRUE}
# Create a vector.
apple <- c('red','green',"yellow")
print(apple)

# Get the class of the vector.
print(class(apple))
```


## 04.04 Lists

A list is an R-object which can contain many different types of elements inside it like vectors, functions and even another list inside it.

```{r code10, echo=TRUE}
# Create a list.
list1 <- list(c(2,5,3),21.3,sin)

# Print the list.
print(list1)
```

## 04.05 Matrices

A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function.

```{r code11, echo=TRUE}
# Create a matrix.
M = matrix( c('a','a','b','c','b','a'),
            nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(M)
```


## 04.06 Arrays

While matrices are confined to two dimensions, arrays can be of any number of dimensions. 
The array function takes a dim attribute which creates the required number of dimension. 
In the next example we create an array with two elements which are 3x3 matrices each.


## Array Example
```{r code12, echo=TRUE}
# Create an array.
a <- array(c('green','yellow'),dim = c(3,3,2))
print(a)
```

## 04.07 Factors

+ Factors are the r-objects which are created using a vector. It stores the vector along with the distinct values of the elements in the vector as labels. 
+ The labels are always character irrespective of whether it is numeric or character or Boolean etc. in the input vector. They are useful in statistical modeling.

+ Factors are created using the `factor()` function. The nlevels functions gives the count of levels.

## Factors Example

```{r code13, echo=TRUE}
# Create a vector.
apple_colors <- c('green','green','yellow','red','red','red','green')

# Create a factor object.
factor_apple <- factor(apple_colors)

# Print the factor.
print(factor_apple)
print(nlevels(factor_apple))
```


## 04.08 Dataframes

+ Data frames are tabular data objects. Unlike a matrix in data frame each column can contain different modes of data. 
+ The first column can be numeric while the second column can be character and third column can be logical. It is a list of vectors of equal length.

+ Data Frames are created using the `data.frame()` function.

## Dataframe Example

```{r code14, echo=TRUE}
# Create the data frame.
BMI <- 	data.frame(
   gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"), 
   height = c(152, 171.5, 165), 
   weight = c(81,93, 78),
   Age = c(42,38,26)
)
print(BMI)
```

## 05.01 Assign Values to Variables

Creating variables requires two steps:

+ Create the variable name
+ Assign values to the variable name using the assignment operator `<-`

## 05.02 Naming Variables

When naming variables in R, there are some rules to follow:

+ Variable names consists of letters, numbers, a dot, or an underscore.
+ We can begin a variable name with a letter or a dot, but dots cannot be followed by a number.
+ We cannot begin a variable name with a number.
+ No special characters are allowed.

## 05.03 Variable Names

| Variable Name      | Validity | Reason                                                                    |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| var_name2.         | valid    | Has letters, numbers, dot and underscore                                  |
| var_name%          | Invalid  | Has the character '%'. Only dot(.) and underscore allowed.                |
| 2var_name          | invalid  | Starts with a number                                                      |
| .var_name,var.name | var.name | Can start with a dot(.) but the dot(.)should not be followed by a number. |
| .2var_name         | invalid  | The starting dot is followed by a number making it invalid.               |
| _var_name          | invalid  | Starts with _ which is not valid                                          

## 05.04 Variable Assignment

The variables can be assigned values using leftward, rightward and equal to operator. The values of the variables can be printed using `print()` or `cat()` function. The `cat()` function combines multiple items into a continuous print output.


```{r code15, echo=TRUE}
# Assignment using equal operator.
var.1 = c(0,1,2,3)           

# Assignment using leftward operator.
var.2 <- c("learn","R")   

# Assignment using rightward operator.   
c(TRUE,1) -> var.3           

print(var.1)
cat ("var.1 is ", var.1 ,"\n")
cat ("var.2 is ", var.2 ,"\n")
cat ("var.3 is ", var.3 ,"\n")
```

## Instructions

+ Refer to the table of class data to calculate your final grade in each of your classes:

    + Chemistry
    + Writing
    + Art
    + History
    + Music
    + Physical Education

+ Store the results of your analysis into variables and combine them to a variable final_scores
+ Using Variables Calculate gpa ( gpa = final_grades/7)
 
## Goodness of Vectors

+ Use the `mean()` function to calculate your grade point average from the final_scores vector that we created earlier. Store the result of your calculation in the variable gpa.

+ Use the `max()` function to identify the highest final grade in the final_scores vector.
+ Use the `min()` function to identify the lowest final grade in the final_scores vector.
+ Use the `length()` function to calculate the total number of classes.

## 06. Operators


An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. R language is rich in built-in operators and provides following types of operators.

### Types of Operators
We have the following types of operators in R programming −

+ Arithmetic Operators
+ Relational Operators
+ Logical Operators
+ Assignment Operators
+ Miscellaneous Operators

## Arithmetic Operators 

 `+` Adds two vectors

```{r code16, echo=TRUE}
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v+t)
```

 `-` Subtracts second vector from the first

```{r code17, echo=TRUE}
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v-t)
```

## Arithmetic Operators

 `*` Multiplies both vectors

```{r code18, echo=TRUE}
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v*t)
```

 `/` Divide the first vector with the second

```{r code19, echo=TRUE}
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v/t)
```

## Arithmetic Operators

 `%%` Give the remainder of the first vector with the second

```{r code20, echo=TRUE}
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v%%t)
```

 `%/%` The result of division of first vector with second (quotient)

```{r code21, echo=TRUE}
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v%/%t)
```

## Arithmetic Operators

`^` The first vector raised to the exponent of second vector

```{r code22, echo=TRUE}
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v^t)
```

## Relational Operators

Each element of the first vector is compared with the corresponding element of the second vector. The result of comparison is a Boolean value.

### 1. Greater Than `(>)`

Checks if each element of the first vector is greater than the corresponding element of the second vector.

```{r code23, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v>t)
```

## 2. Less than `(<)`

Checks if each element of the first vector is less than the corresponding element of the second vector.

```{r code24, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v < t)
```

## 3. Equality `(==)`

Checks if each element of the first vector is equal to the corresponding element of the second vector.

```{r code25, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v == t)
```

## 4. Less equal `(<=)`

Checks if each element of the first vector is less than or equal to the corresponding element of the second vector.

```{r code26, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v<=t)
```
## 5. Greater Equal `(>=)`
Checks if each element of the first vector is greater than or equal to the corresponding element of the second vector.

```{r code27, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v>=t)
```

## 6. Not Equal `(!=)`

Checks if each element of the first vector is unequal to the corresponding element of the second vector.

```{r code28, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v!=t)
```

## Logical Operators

It is applicable only to vectors of type logical, numeric or complex. All numbers greater than 1 are considered as logical value TRUE.

Each element of the first vector is compared with the corresponding element of the second vector. The result of comparison is a Boolean value.


## Element Wise Logical AND `(&)`

It combines each element of the first vector with the corresponding element of the second vector and gives a output TRUE if both the elements are TRUE.


```{r code29, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(3,1,TRUE,2+3i)
t <- c(4,1,FALSE,2+3i)
print(v&t)
```



## Element Wise Logical OR `(|)`

It combines each element of the first vector with the corresponding element of the second vector and gives a output TRUE if one the elements is TRUE.

```{r code30, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i)
t <- c(4,0,FALSE,2+3i)
print(v|t)
```

## Logical NOT `(!)`

Takes each element of the vector and gives the opposite logical value.

```{r code32, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i)
print(!v)
```

The logical operator && and || considers only the first element of the vectors and give a vector of single element as output.

## Logical AND `(&&)`

Takes first element of both the vectors and gives the TRUE only if both are TRUE.

```{r code33, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i)
t <- c(1,3,TRUE,2+3i)
print(v&&t)
```

## Logical OR `(||)`

 Takes first element of both the vectors and gives the TRUE if one of them is TRUE
 
```{r code34, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(0,0,TRUE,2+2i)
t <- c(0,3,TRUE,2+3i)
print(v||t)
```

## Miscelleneous Operators

These operators are used to for specific purpose and not general mathematical or logical computation.

### Colon Operator `(:)`

It creates the series of numbers in sequence for a vector.

```{r code3x, echo=TRUE}
v <- 2:8
print(v) 
```

## %in%

This operator is used to identify if an element belongs to a vector.

```{r code35, echo=TRUE}
v1 <- 8
v2 <- 12
t <- 1:10
print(v1 %in% t) 
print(v2 %in% t) 
```

## %*%

This operator is used to multiply a matrix with its transpose

```{r code36,echo=TRUE}
M = matrix( c(2,6,5,1,10,4), nrow = 2,ncol = 3,byrow = TRUE)
t = M %*% t(M)
print(t)
```


## Decision Making

Decision making structures require the programmer to specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.

![](images/decision.png)


## If statement

An if statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.

Flow Diagram

![](images/if.png)

## If statement : Example

```{r code3y, echo=TRUE}
x <- 30L
if(is.integer(x)) {
   print("X is an Integer")
}
```


## If ... else statement

An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.

Flow Diagram

![](images/else.png)
## Example:

### if ... else statement

```{r code4z, echo=TRUE}
x <- c("what","is","truth")

if("Truth" %in% x) {
   print("Truth is found")
} else {
   print("Truth is not found")
}
```

### The if...else if...else Statement

```{r codexs, echo=TRUE}
x <- c("what","is","truth")

if("Truth" %in% x) {
   print("Truth is found the first time")
} else if ("truth" %in% x) {
   print("truth is found the second time")
} else {
   print("No truth found")
}
```


## Switch statement

A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

Flow Diagram

![](images/switch.png)

## Example : Switch

```{r codewe, echo=TRUE}
x <- switch(
   3,
   "first",
   "second",
   "third",
   "fourth"
)
print(x)

```

## Loops

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and the following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages −

![](images/loops.png)


## Repeat Loop

Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
Flow Diagram

![](images/repeat.png)


## Example : Repeat Loop

```{r code37, echo=TRUE}
v <- c("Hello","loop")
cnt <- 2

repeat {
   print(v)
   cnt <- cnt+1
   
   if(cnt > 5) {
      break
   }
}
```


## while loop

Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

Flow Diagram

![](images/while.png)

## Example : While Loop

```{r code38, echo=TRUE}
v <- c("Hello","while loop")
cnt <- 2

while (cnt < 7) {
   print(v)
   cnt = cnt + 1
}
```

## for loop

Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.

Flow Diagram

![](images/for.png)


## Loop control statements

Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

### break statement
Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.

### Next statement
The next statement simulates the behavior of R switch.

## Next Statement
Flow Diagram

![](images/next.png)

## Next: Example

```{r code39, echo=TRUE}
v <- LETTERS[1:6]
for ( i in v) {
   
   if (i == "D") {
      next
   }
   print(i)
}
```
