Designate set.seed(1) to make the results reproducible.\nii. Sample 30 rows from the wnba dataframe. Save the results as thirty_samples.\niii. Calculate the average age of this sample group. Assign the results to mean_age.\niv. Calculate the average number of games played for this sample group. Assign the results to mean_games.\n\n\n## Solution 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1)\nds_30 <- sample_n(ds,size=30)\nmean_age <- mean(ds_30$Age, na.rm=T)\nmean_games <- mean(ds_30$Games_Played, na.rm = T)\n```\n:::\n\n\n+ The mean age is 27.3333333\n+ The mean number of games 24.9\n\n\n## Creating and Analyzing Strata with dplyr\n\n+ When can use the `group_by()` function to create strata\n+ We can then apply one or more functions for each strata\n\n\n## Getting Mean by Stratum\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1)\nds %>% \n  # Split: stratify by player position\n  group_by(Pos) %>% \n  # Apply: sample 10 observations for each player position stratum\n  sample_n(10) %>%\n  # Apply & combine: calculate average points scored for each stratum, combine results\n  summarize(mean_pts = mean(PTS))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 Ã— 2\n  Pos   mean_pts\n  <chr>    <dbl>\n1 C         84.4\n2 F        162. \n3 F/C      250. \n4 G        229. \n5 G/F      184. \n```\n:::\n:::\n",
