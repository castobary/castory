Find the maximum number of games played in the whole dataset `parameter`\nii. Use the `sample()` to random sample 30 players `sample`\niii. Find the maximum number of games played in the sample `statistic`\niv. Calculate the sampling error `sampling_error`\n\n## Solution 1\n\n```{r}\nparameter <- max(ds$Games_Played, na.rm = T)\n\nset.seed(1)\nsample <- sample(ds$Games_Played,30)\n\nstatistic <- max(sample, na.rm = T)\n\nsampling_error = parameter - statistic\n\n```\n\n## Representative Sample\n\n+ Samples with a small sampling error are considered representative\n\n![](images/Samples.svg)\n\n\n+ The sample should be selected randomly from the population.\n\n\n## Random Sample\n\n+ Every individual has an equal chance of being picked.\n+ Can be archived by generating random numbers and use them to pick individuals from the population\n\n![](images/s1m1_Simple_random_sampling_v2.svg)\n\n## Sampling with(out) Replacement\n\n+ Using the `sample()` can extract samples from a dataset with or without replacement\n+ The default is `replace = FALSE`\n+ A particular sample can not be drawn more than once during a sampling event\n\n\n## `sample_n()` function\n\n+ From `dplyr` package\n+ Can be used to sample rows from multiple columns\n+ Unlike the `sample()` which samples observations from a single column (vector)\n\n## `set.seed()` function\n\n+ Uses a *pseudorandom number generator*\n\n>  pseudorandom number generator uses an initial value to generate a sequence of numbers that has properties similar to those of a sequence that is truly random. The purpose of this is to start a random sequence that can be reproduced later.\n\n+ When you use `set.seed()` you will get same results repeatedly.\n\n## Base r `replicate()` function\n\n+ Used for repeated evaluation of an epression\n\n+ `replicate(n,expr)`\n\n+ `expr` is a function call or formula\n\n## Replicate 100 samples\n\n![](images/replicate.svg)\n\n## Task 2\n\nGenerate a vector of 100 random sample means for the PTS column, with a sample size of 10.\n\n  1. Set the random seed to 1.\n  2. Use `replicate()` to generate a vector of 100 random sample means of sample size 10.\n      - Save the results of the analysis as mean_points.\n  3. Calculate the minimum value of mean_points, and save as minimum.\n  4. Calculate the maximum value of mean_points, and save as maximum.\n    \n## Solution 2\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(1)\n# Mean for one sample\nmean(sample(ds$PTS,10))\n\n# Mean for 100 samples\nsample_means <- replicate(100,mean(sample(ds$PTS,10)))\n\nminimum <- min(sample_means)\nmaximum <- max(sample_means)\n```\n\n## Visualizing the sample_means\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-show: animate\nx <- 1:100\n\ndf <- tibble(x,sample_means)\n\nggplot(data = df, \n       aes(x = x, y = sample_means )) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = mean(ds$PTS), \n    color = \"blue\") +\n    ylim(90, 310)+\n   theme_classic()\n\n```\n\n## Remarks\n\n+ we can see that the sample means vary a lot around the population mean. \n\n![](images/Graphic_1.png)\n\n\n## Remarks\n\n+ Because of the high variation, there is a good chance we get a sample mean that is not representative of the population.\n\n![](images/Graphic_2.png)\n\n\n## Remarks\n\n+ Increasing the sample size addresses the problem\n+ Increasing the sample size the sample means vary less\n+ Chances of getting unrepresentative sample decreases\n\n\n## Remarks\n\n![](images/grid.png)\n\n## Remarks\n\n> Simple random sampling isn't a reliable sampling method when the sample size is small. Because sample means vary a lot around the population mean, there's a good chance we'll get an unrepresentative sample\n\n> When we do simple random sampling, we should try to get as large a sample as possible. A large sample decreases the variability of the sampling process, which, in turn, decreases the chances that we'll get an unrepresentative sample\n\n## Remarks\n\n![](images/Graphic_3.png)"},"formats":{"revealjs":{"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","output-file":"random_sampling-cm-Latitude-5300.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":false,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","auto-stretch":true,"title":"Simple Random Sampling","author":"Castory Munishi","date":"11/04/2022","editor":"visual"}}}}
