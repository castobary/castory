Today we know this virus as Coronavirus. COVID-19 which stands for COronaVIrus Disease is the disease caused by this virus. Since then, the world has been engaged in the fight against this pandemic. Several measures have therefore been taken to \"flatten the curve\". We have consequently experienced social distancing and many people have passed away as well.\n\nIn the solidarity to face this unprecedented global crisis, several organizations did not hesitate to share several datasets allowing the conduction of several kinds of analysis in order to understand this pandemic.\n\nOur analysis tries to provide an answer to this question: Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?\n\n### Information about the dataset\n\nThe dataset of our study contains daily & cumulative number of COVID-19 tests conducted, number of positive, hospitalized, recovered & death cases reported by country. In details here are the columns in the dataset:\n\n-   *Date*: Date\n-   *Continent_Name*: Continent names\n-   *Two_Letter_Country_Code*: Country codes\n-   *Country_Region*: Country names\n-   *Province_State*: States/province names; value is All States when state/provincial level data is not available\n-   *positive*: Cumulative number of positive cases reported.\n-   *active*: Number of active cases on that **day**.\n-   *hospitalized*: Cumulative number of hospitalized cases reported.\n-   *hospitalizedCurr*: Number of actively hospitalized cases on that **day**.\n-   *recovered*: Cumulative number of recovered cases reported.\n-   *death*: Cumulative number of deaths reported.\n-   *total_tested*: Cumulative number of tests conducted.\n-   *daily_tested*: Number of tests conducted on the **day**; if daily data is unavailable, daily tested is averaged across number of days in between.\n-   *daily_positive*: Number of positive cases reported on the **day**; if daily data is unavailable, daily positive is averaged across number of days in.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# loading packages and loading the dataset\npacman::p_load(\n  tidyverse,\n  magrittr)\n\nds <- read_csv(\"covid19.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Task One\n\n-   Determine the dimension of the dataframe, covid_df by using the function `dim()`\n\n-   Determine the column names of covid_df using the colnames() function.\n\n    -   Store the result in the variable named vector_cols.\n    -   Display the content of this variable.\n    -   What data structure the vector_cols variable represents?\n\n-   Display the first few rows of the covid_df dataset using the function head()\n\n-   Display the summary of the covid_df dataset using the function glimpse() from the tibble package.\n\n    -   Why is the glimpse() function useful when exploring a new dataset?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# dataframe dimensions\ndim(ds)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 10903    14\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# column names\nvector_cols <- colnames(ds)\nvector_cols\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Date\"                    \"Continent_Name\"         \n [3] \"Two_Letter_Country_Code\" \"Country_Region\"         \n [5] \"Province_State\"          \"positive\"               \n [7] \"hospitalized\"            \"recovered\"              \n [9] \"death\"                   \"total_tested\"           \n[11] \"active\"                  \"hospitalizedCurr\"       \n[13] \"daily_tested\"            \"daily_positive\"         \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDisplaying first ten six rows\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::kable(head(ds,6))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Date       |Continent_Name |Two_Letter_Country_Code |Country_Region |Province_State | positive| hospitalized| recovered| death| total_tested| active| hospitalizedCurr| daily_tested| daily_positive|\n|:----------|:--------------|:-----------------------|:--------------|:--------------|--------:|------------:|---------:|-----:|------------:|------:|----------------:|------------:|--------------:|\n|2020-01-20 |Asia           |KR                      |South Korea    |All States     |        1|            0|         0|     0|            4|      0|                0|            0|              0|\n|2020-01-22 |North America  |US                      |United States  |All States     |        1|            0|         0|     0|            1|      0|                0|            0|              0|\n|2020-01-22 |North America  |US                      |United States  |Washington     |        1|            0|         0|     0|            1|      0|                0|            0|              0|\n|2020-01-23 |North America  |US                      |United States  |All States     |        1|            0|         0|     0|            1|      0|                0|            0|              0|\n|2020-01-23 |North America  |US                      |United States  |Washington     |        1|            0|         0|     0|            1|      0|                0|            0|              0|\n|2020-01-24 |Asia           |KR                      |South Korea    |All States     |        2|            0|         0|     0|           27|      0|                0|            5|              0|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset structure\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(ds)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 10,903\nColumns: 14\n$ Date                    <date> 2020-01-20, 2020-01-22, 2020-01-22, 2020-01-2…\n$ Continent_Name          <chr> \"Asia\", \"North America\", \"North America\", \"Nor…\n$ Two_Letter_Country_Code <chr> \"KR\", \"US\", \"US\", \"US\", \"US\", \"KR\", \"US\", \"US\"…\n$ Country_Region          <chr> \"South Korea\", \"United States\", \"United States…\n$ Province_State          <chr> \"All States\", \"All States\", \"Washington\", \"All…\n$ positive                <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1…\n$ hospitalized            <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ recovered               <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ death                   <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ total_tested            <dbl> 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 27, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ active                  <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ hospitalizedCurr        <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ daily_tested            <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ daily_positive          <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince Province_state contains multiple levels of data, extract only the country-level data in order to not bias our analyses.

Feel free at the end of the project to come back to this step and do different kind of filtering, e.g., focus only on a country.\n\n## Task Two\n\n-   Filter the rows related to \"All States\" from the Province_State column and remove the Province_State column from covid_df dataframe.\n    -   Store the result in df\n-   Why can we remove the Province_State column without losing information from our dataset?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- ds %>%\n  filter(Province_State %in% \"All States\") %>%\n  select(-Province_State)\ndim(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3781   13\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRevisiting the description of the dataset columns above (not on the days), we can notice that there are columns that provide daily information and others that provide cumulative information.\n\nWe should manage those cases (columns with cumulative and daily information) separately because we cannot work with both together. Actually, our analysis would be biased if we made the mistake of comparing a column containing cumulative data and another one containing only one-day data. This is another example of a situation that we want to know from the beginning of the project in order to better analyze our dataset.\n\n## Task Three\n\n-   Select the following column, related to the daily measures, from the covid_df_all_states: Date, Country_Region, active, hospitalizedCurr, daily_tested, daily_positive.\n    -   Store the result in covid_df_all_states_daily.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_df_all_states_daily <- df %>%\n  select(Date, Country_Region, active, hospitalizedCurr, daily_tested, daily_positive)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOur goal here is to extract the top ten cases countries data. Acting like a data scientist, at this step, these are the questions we are asking ourselves.\n\n-   How can we get the overall number of COVID-19 tested, positive, active and hospitalized cases by country since we currently have daily data?\n-   How do we then extract the top ten?\n\n## Task Four\n\n-   Write code to summarize the covid_df_all_states_daily dataframe by computing the sum of the number of tested, positive, active and hospitalized cases grouped by the Country_Region column.\n\n    -   Use the function `group_by()` to group rows by Country_Region column.\n\n    -   Combine the function `summarize()` and the function `sum()` to compute the sum for each column.\n\n        -   Assign the sum of daily_tested to the column name tested.\n        -   Assign the sum of daily_positive to the column name positive.\n        -   Assign the sum of active to the column name active.\n        -   Assign the sum of hospitalizedCurr to the column name hospitalized.\n        -   Arrange the tested column in descending order using the function `arrange()`.\n\n-   Store the result in the variable covid_df_all_states_daily_sum.\n\n-   Display this dataframe.\n\n-   Extract the top ten rows from the covid_df_all_states_daily_sum dataframe using the command head(covid_df_all_states_daily_sum, 10)\n\n-   Store the result in the variable named covid_top_10.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_df_all_states_daily_sum <- covid_df_all_states_daily %>%\n  group_by(Country_Region) %>%\n  summarise(tested=sum(daily_tested),\n            positive=sum(daily_positive),\n            active=sum(active),\n            hospitalized=sum(hospitalizedCurr)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(tested))\n\ncovid_top_10 <- head(covid_df_all_states_daily_sum, 10)\n\nknitr::kable(covid_top_10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Country_Region |   tested| positive|  active| hospitalized|\n|:--------------|--------:|--------:|-------:|------------:|\n|United States  | 17282363|  1877179|       0|            0|\n|Russia         | 10542266|   406368| 6924890|            0|\n|Italy          |  4091291|   251710| 6202214|      1699003|\n|India          |  3692851|    60959|       0|            0|\n|Turkey         |  2031192|   163941| 2980960|            0|\n|Canada         |  1654779|    90873|   56454|            0|\n|United Kingdom |  1473672|   166909|       0|            0|\n|Australia      |  1252900|     7200|  134586|         6655|\n|Peru           |   976790|    59497|       0|            0|\n|Poland         |   928256|    23987|  538203|            0|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Task Five\n\n-   Create the following vectors from the `covid_top_10` dataframe.\n\n-   Create the countries vector that contains the `Country_Region` column values.
