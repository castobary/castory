If you wrote the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ggplot(data = life_expec_sex) +\n#   aes(x = Year, y = Avg_Life_Expec) +\n#   geom_line() +\n#   facet_wrap(~Sex, ncol = 2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## nrow and ncol in facetting\n\n+ The resulting graph would be identical to the one above, since the panels will be arranged in two columns.\n\n+ However, you could create a graph with panels stacked one on top of the other by specifying either ncol = 1 or nrow = 2.\n\n## Task\n\n+ Let's visualize U.S. women's and men's life expectancies on separate panels so you can compare how they have changed over time.\n\n     1.

Why might this be?\n\n## Graphing Subset of Data\n\n+ When you want to hone in on an interesting subset of your data for further investigation, one way to do so is to set scale limits.\n\n+ Changing the scale limits changes the range of your axes so you can display only a portion of your data.\n\n+ For example, let's say you wanted to create a graph displaying only the 1918 dip in life expectancy due to influenza.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot6 <- ggplot(life_expec_sex) + \n         aes(x = Year, y = Avg_Life_Expec, color = Sex) +\n         geom_line() +\n         xlim(1915, 1920) +\n         ylim(35, 60)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot6\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](multi_line_files/figure-revealjs/code15-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Using limits\n\n+ In the previous graph, the x-axis years range from 1915 to 1920, and the y-axis life expectancies range from 35 to 60 years old. \n\n+ We have zoomed in on this portion of the graph by changing the scale limits.\n\n+  By default, when you use `ggplot()` to greate a graph, all observations will be included. \n\n+ Adding `xlim()` and `ylim()` layers to the graph allows you to specify ranges to display only a subset of the data.\n\n+ Looking at the graph of life expectancies for the years 1915 to 1920 allows you to clearly visualize the devastating effect that the flu pandemic had on life expectancies.\n\n## Task\n\n+ Earlier, we discussed the interesting differences in life expectancy fluctuations before and after 1950.\n\n+ Let's create a graph focused on life expectancy data from before 1950.\n\n+ Add a new layer to the line graph of men's and women's life expectancies to hone in on the years between 1900 and 1950.\n\n\n## Solution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot7<- ggplot( data = life_expec_sex) +\n  aes( x = Year , y = Avg_Life_Expec, color = Sex ) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlim(1900, 1950) + \n  ylim(35, 80) +\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancies of US Males and Female 1900 - 1950\",\n       y = \"Average Life Expectacy (Years)\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Plot Display\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot7\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](multi_line_files/figure-revealjs/code17-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Comments\n\n+ This visualization can allow you to take a closer look at the year-to-year variability in life expectancy during the first half of the twentieth century.\n\n+ What do you think could be some potential causes? Perhaps a greater impact of infectious diseases prior to medical advances such as vaccines for polio, measles, and influenza? \n\n+ This could be an interesting topic to study, and demonstrates some of the types of questions  that arise when you visualize data graphically instead of looking at it in tabular form.\n\n## Exploring the data further\n\n### The differences in life expectancy between white and black americans\n\n+ To do this, you will need to use a different subset of data from the life_expec data frame:\n\n      1.
