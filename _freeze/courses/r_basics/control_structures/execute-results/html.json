Since you want to perform the addition operation for each row of the data frame,\n\n+  the first part of the for-loop will consist of defining i as an element of the sequence of numbers from one to the number of rows in  the data frame. \n\n+ Here's how you'll specify the sequence: `for ( i in 1:nrow(scores))`\n\n+ \"for each element in the sequence one to 64\"\n\n+ In programming, it's good practice to refer to data objects instead of including numbers in your code. \n\n## The Loop\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# for ( i in 1:nrow(scores)){\n#  print(scores$home_goals[i] + scores$away_goals[i])\n#}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Task \n\nWrite a for-loop to subtract away_goals from home_goals for each match in scores. \n\n## Solution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# for (i in 1:nrow(scores)){\n#  print(scores$home_goals[i] - scores$away_goals[i])\n# }\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Nested Control Structures 1/2\n\n+ Control structures are powerful tools, and can do even more when combined together. \n\n+  For example, the actions repeated by a for-loop don't need to be sequential code — they could be conditional statements.\n+ This pattern of executing one or more control structures inside another one is called **nesting**.\n\n+ Objective : Originally, we wanted to create a new variable that provides information about whether the home team won or lost each match.\n\n\n## Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (i in 1:nrow(scores)){\n  if(scores$home_goals[i] > scores$away_goals[i]){\n    print(\"home team won\")\n  }else{\n    print('home team did not win')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team did not win\"\n[1] \"home team won\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Nested Control Structures 2/2\n\n+ Nested control structures are very powerful, but can be tricky to get used to and can make finding errors in your code harder. \n\n+  The workflow in the previous examples is a good way to avoid problems when writing nested control structures: \n\n+ Start by writing the inner operation and make sure it works correctly, and then wrap the outer operation around it.\n\n+ Next, you'll learn to store the output of a loop in a variable.
