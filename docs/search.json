Fires can also range in intensity too, so it might be useful to know what factors influence this as well.\nLooking at the data immediately though, there is no variable that describes just “severity”. Many times in analysis, we’ll be interested in a variable, but simply won’t have the data for it. In these cases, we often have to look at proxies, or a kind of “representation” of severity. In this data set, the area variable contains data on the number of hectares of forest that burned during the forest fire. We’ll use this variable as an indicator of the severity of the fire. The idea behind using area as a proxy is that worse fires will result in a larger burned area. Of course, this won’t be true in all cases, but it is a reasonable assumption to make."
